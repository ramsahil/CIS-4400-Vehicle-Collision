# CIS-4400-Vehicle-Collision

Our data warehouse was created in hopes of drawing some insights into what causes vehicle collisions in our city in order to come up with solutions to this issues. 
We felt that by looking at collision data provided by NYC with other data sets like uber rides, weather conditions, and party noise complaints we might be able to 
draw some conclusions about the accidents happening in our city.
